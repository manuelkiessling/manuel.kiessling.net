2025-10-17|🇩🇪 DX·Tooling Live Coding Session| Im Kontext des DX·Tooling Projekts habe ich eine erste Live Coding Session aufgezeichnet, bei der ich unter anderem zeige, wie man mithilfe von speziellen Softwaretests die Einhaltung von Architekturregeln in einer Codebase garantieren kann: https://youtu.be/i0l7Sh2Hj-o
2025-10-08|New find: Toxiproxy|Just found out about [Toxiproxy](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy), a network proxy that can be used to simulate network conditions locally. It allowed me to pinpoint a performance issue in one of my applications, where the severity of a N+1 query pattern was not really visible on my dev system (where app and database live on the same host), but was painfully visible on the production system. I've put Toxiproxy between the app and the database (app connects to Toxiproxy, Toxiproxy connects to database), added a bit of latency to the connection, and voilà, realistic behavior (and realistic performance degradation) on my MacBook.
2025-09-22||[MCP as a Service](https://mcp-as-a-service.com) now supports user-provided env vars that are passed into the MCP instance container. Starting today, it also offers launching [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) MCP server instances, based on [the MCP implementation by CognitionAI](https://github.com/CognitionAI/metabase-mcp-server), and allows to pass in the Metabase domain and API key through this env var mechanism. See [Pull Request #11](https://github.com/dx-tooling/maas-webapp/pull/11) for details.
