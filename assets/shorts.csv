2025-09-22||[MCP as a Service](https://mcp-as-a-service.com) now supports user-provided env vars that are passed into the MCP instance container. Starting today, it also offers launching [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) MCP server instances, based on [the MCP implementation by CognitionAI](https://github.com/CognitionAI/metabase-mcp-server), and allows to pass in the Metabase domain and API key through this env var mechanism. See [Pull Request #11](https://github.com/dx-tooling/maas-webapp/pull/11) for details.
